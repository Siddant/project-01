# Mastermind

![mastermind](https://media.git.generalassemb.ly/user/15120/files/da59cd00-fec9-11e8-85e7-013d3493c247)

Mastermind is a code-breaking game. A pattern of four colour pegs is established at the start of each game, and the player must try to guess the correct pattern within a certain number of attempts.

The player is given clues as to how close they are to the correct pattern as they go, which helps to inform their next guess.

## Resources

* [How to Play Mastermind (Code Breaker) - Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwuwWTH39ac)
* [Mastermind (board game) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game))

## Requirements

* The game should be playable for one player with the computer creating the code to guess
* Once the game has been completed the player should be prompted to play again

## Suggested enhancements

* Different difficulty levels
* Two player mode on the same computer: first to 5 wins, with a tie-break

## Challenges

The main difficulty here is the feedback after each attempt, to indicate if there is a correct colour in the correct square, a correct colour in an incorrect square and no match at all. The solution will invariably involve a heavy use of array methods.

## Tips

* Make sure you spend plenty of time planning _before_ you start coding
* Make sure you understand all of the rules of the game
* Make a checklist of all the features you want to add to the game
* Keep It Stupid Simple
* Refactor your code as you go
* Make sure you have a good idea of what your MVP is and only add extra features once you have achieved it
* Do just enough styling to get started, then once you have your MVP polish up the styling before moving on
