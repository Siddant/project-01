# Snakes and Ladders

Snakes and Ladders is a classic children's board game. Players roll a die to determine how many squares to move their token. The token moves from the bottom of the board to the top left to right, then right to left on the next row and so on, until they reach the last square at the top of the board.

If the player's token lands at the bottom of a ladder, they can move to the top of the ladder, advancing toward the goal. If the player's token lands at the head of a snake, they must move to the tail, distancing them further from the goal.

The player that reaches the last square first wins.

* [Snakes and Ladders - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snakes_and_Ladders)

## Requirements

* The game should be playable for one player, playing against the computer
* The winner should be displayed when the game is over

## Suggested enhancements

* Responsive design
* Random board generation
* Different board sizes and or number of snakes

## Challenges

The game is fairly straightforward, and with some clever use of `flex` and `HTML` can be implemented fairly elegantly. The challenge comes with the random board generation, particularly when the snakes and ladders images need to be placed on the board.

## Tips

* Make sure you spend plenty of time planning _before_ you start coding
* Make sure you understand all of the rules of the game
* Make a checklist of all the features you want to add to the game
* Keep It Stupid Simple
* Refactor your code as you go
* Make sure you have a good idea of what your MVP is and only add extra features once you have achieved it
* Do just enough styling to get started, then once you have your MVP polish up the styling before moving on
